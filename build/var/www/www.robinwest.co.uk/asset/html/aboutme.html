<h1>Hi, I'm Robin&hellip;</h1>
<p>I'm a front end web developer specialising in UI and UX design based in Surrey, UK.</p>
<p>I'm an avid fan of most things creative; music, typography, photography, programming, illustration, design. I love trying out new techniques and throwing myself at things I don't know yet.</p>
<p>If I'm not doing one of the above I'm probably socialising, playing video games or watching old-school horror movies - usually with a beer in hand!</p>
