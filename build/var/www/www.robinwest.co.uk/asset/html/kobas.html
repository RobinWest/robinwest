<h1>KOBAS</h1>
<p>I am currently working on the UX team at <a href="http://www.kobas.co.uk/" target="_blank">KOBAS</a> located in central London. In a fast paced environment on a small team, I am responsible for ensuring our clients have a great experience, whether they are busting open beers behind a bar or booking some holiday on our cloud platform.</p>
<p>Ensuring a consistent user experience across multiple devices with varying degrees of internet connectivity can be difficult, but visiting our clients bars and restaurants to see how they work is both insightful and fun!</p>
