<h1>Sign-Up.to</h1>
<p>I was previously the User Experience Lead at <a href="http://www.signupto.com/" target="_blank">Sign-Up.to</a>. Upon joining the Interaction team I worked to improve the user experience of the Sign-Up.to platform and the processes used to develop their applications.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Implemented a combination of design studio sessions, early paper prototyping, and iterative, usability-lead development for new applications.</li>
	<li>Implemented analytics tools across specific areas of the platform to gain insight and smooth out common choke-points for new and existing users.</li>
	<li>Using web technologies such as Backbone.js, Node.js, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3  to create snappy, easy to use applications with complex functionality.</li>
	<li>Integration with Sign-Up.to's own RESTful <a href="http://dev.sign-up.to" target="_blank">PMAPI</a>.</li>
</ul>
