	<li>Implemented analytics tools across specific areas of the platform to gain insight and smooth out common choke-points for new and existing users.</li>
	<li>Using web technologies such as Backbone.js, Node.js, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3  to create snappy, easy to use applications with complex functionality.</li>
	<li>Integration with Sign-Up.to's own RESTful <a href="http://dev.sign-up.to" target="_blank">PMAPI</a>.</li>
