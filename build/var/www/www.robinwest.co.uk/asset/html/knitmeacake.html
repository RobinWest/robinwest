<h1>Knit me a cake</h1>
<p>My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/LeanneBeale" target="_blank">@LeanneBeale</a> wanted a new logo and colour scheme created for her craft blog. We were both pleased with how the design turned out but recently a tough decision was made - to close the blog and, after a short break, make a <a href="http://thislittlespaceofmine.co.uk/" target="_blank">fresh start</a>.</p>
<p>I created the logo by using a chalk board and pens to give it a home made feel, then used Adobe Illustrator to vectorise and arrange the different elements.</p>
